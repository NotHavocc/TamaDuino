**REQUIREMENTS**
This project used an Dasduino Core (spinoff nano), although you can use most boards.
Project uses 67% of Dasduinos'(nano's) memory (max is 30720 bytes). So this project requires a board
with atleast 2000bytes of storage.
I reccomend an 128x64 display for better viewability, although 128x32 is supported.
